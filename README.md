# LYONS-Prints

Throughout my undergrad I’ve been doing part time work at my university’s 3D printing centre, it was here that I turned a typical administrative student job into my first taste at developing scalable and user centred software. I noticed that employees would spend so much time on processing 3D prints which would hold them back from assisting patrons at the front desk. So I developed an application that saved them time by automating this process and updating the centre’s database in a matter of seconds. I built on this further to develop a GUI desktop application that the centre now uses for seemlessly automating 3D print processing.
